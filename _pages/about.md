My name is Toshy and I started learning Python in september 2021. Until then my sole purpose was music and everything that comes with it. Technology was always a passion but I never dared diving into the deep learning abyss of the digital world.

I don't regret it. I learn every day and it get's better with each new skill.
This site is my documentation of how I turned my life around and made it so much better in the process.

Welcome!
