Welcome to SnekHome!
I just recently learned about Jekyll and Ruby-on-Rails and how easy it is to create a GitHub-Page with it.
This is my first attempt at it and a starting point for what is about to become a beautiful portfolio site and blog.
Come along on my path to becoming a successfull programmer. This is where I will document my journey.

Thank you for stopping by!
